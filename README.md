# LabReport
This is an example of a Latex lab report prepared using the LabReport 
class file. Examples of figures/tables throughout. 

To make a new report, alter the *project* variable in the *Makefile* to
change the name of the output PDF file. Alter the *view* variable in the
*Makefile* to change the default PDF viewing application (e.g., *evince*).
In *Source/Main.tex* you can alter the parameters of your class/section etc.
and give the report a title and abstract. Change the file *input*'s to
include whatever sections you like. Put your references in *Source/Main.bib*.
