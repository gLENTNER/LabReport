\section{Experimental Methods}
I can also include subsections. \blindtext

\subsection{Equipment Setup}
To include a figure within the two column environment use ``Figure''.
To include a figure that spans the two column format, use ``figure*''.
Now I can references my figures as Figure~\ref{fig:Hist1} and
Figure~\ref{fig:fourier}. \LaTeX will decide where to put the 
figures \textit{for me}. 

Some more blank text -- \blindtext

	selected font, how the let- ters are written and an impression of the look. 
	This text should contain all letters of the alpha- bet and it should be 
	written in of the original lan- guage. There is no need for special 
	content, but the length of words should match the language.}
